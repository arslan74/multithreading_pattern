# Multithreading Pattern


Design and implement a Java application with producer/consumer pattern. The producer(s) and consumer(s) can run in the same JVM. You can keep data objects in-memory (no
persistence layer is needed). You can define the data types and structures yourself. No UI or GUI is needed.

## How to run the project?

I have the Intellij as IDE, due to it's simplisty and suppoting different programming and build automation tools.
I would be best to import the project using Intellij and add build configuration for the  project.

There are other ways to use makefile for the automation of the build. But due to limited time, I used IntelliJ IDEA build configuration for setting up the project because main focus was to solve the problem at hand.

## How to start the project?
MainDrive file has main function of project that start the application.
